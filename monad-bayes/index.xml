      <description>Inference Representation Type Classes type R = Double class Monad m =&amp;gt; MonadSample m where random :: m R bernoulli :: R -&amp;gt; m Bool bernoulli p = fmap ( &amp;lt; p ) random -- and other default distributions : -- normal , gamma , beta , geometric , -- poisson , dirichlet class Monad m ⇒ MonadCond m where score :: Log R -&amp;gt; m () class ( MonadSample m , MonadCond m ) =&amp;gt; MonadInfer m  Sampler This inference transformer is a sampler that draws concrete values for random variables from the prior.</description>

      <description>Simulating Data We aim to model a HMM and use it to generate data by simulating a sample path.
First, for simplicity we consider our latent states xi to be integers, and the corresponding observed states yi to also be integers.
data ObservedState = Obs { obs :: Int } deriving Show data LatentState = Lat { lat :: Int } deriving Show We then choose the parameters of the HMM (i.</description>

      <description>A sample path is the course of a program as it executes, hence being the monadic context that the code is executing in. During this path, a new thread created for every random decision. It can be thought of as an execution trace. In probabilistic programming, each sample path is associated with a probability of how likely that execution trace is to happen. This probability is the joint probability of a bunch of random decisions made during the execution of the program.</description>
