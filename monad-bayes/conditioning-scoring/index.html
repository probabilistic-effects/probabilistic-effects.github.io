<main><h1>Conditioning Scoring</h1>
<p>A sample path is the course of a program as it executes, hence being the monadic context that the code is executing in. During this path, a new thread created for every random decision. It can be thought of as an execution trace. In probabilistic programming, each sample path is associated with a probability of how likely that execution trace is to happen. This probability is the joint probability of a bunch of random decisions made during the execution of the program. Some of this may be related to the actual variables in the model used (such as a latent variable we define), but if there is a random decision made, it will also be joint with the random variable corresponding to that random decision.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-haskell" data-lang="haskell"><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">Monad</span> m <span style="color:#f92672">=&gt;</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">MonadCond</span> m <span style="color:#66d9ef">where</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>score</code> function manually updates the probability of a sample path the program is on. For the most part, the probability of each sample path is hard-coded in all the random decisions we make - but the function <code>score</code> acts like an override. When the user calls <code>score</code> midway in a program to update the probability by some specified factor (for example the likelihood that an observed variable y is generated by a latent variable x), they explicitly supply the likelihood resulting from a conditioning operation. This tells the program to update the sample path&rsquo;s associated probability such that during the execution path&rsquo;s hard-coded updating of its probability it is as though the program notices &ldquo;oh, i have some data here to compare to and hence update the sample path&rsquo;s probability appropriately&rdquo;. The fact that <code>score</code> can be called on a double that is calculated by some specific equation is incidental to whatever algorithm, model, or statistical context is implemented in the program.</p>
