  Analysing the dumped core of Population.hs and Weighted.hs of monad-bayes:
It turns out that we should expect to see these definitions, however if we use optimization:2, then we should also expect them to not actually be used. This is because GHC generates a lot of garbage that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to want to remove, but when we go to places where they would have been used, we should be able to find that they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually there.</description>
